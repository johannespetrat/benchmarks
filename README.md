# OptML Benchmarks

This repo contains quality benchmarks for a variety of classification and regression tasks. The team behind [Catboost](https://github.com/catboost/catboost) tested a tuned and an out-of-the-box version of their model against other gradient-boosting methods. In order to examine the effectiveness of [OptML](https://github.com/johannespetrat/OptML) I apply its optimisation methods to the same benchmark problems. At the moment all examples are taken from the catboost benchmark repo.
